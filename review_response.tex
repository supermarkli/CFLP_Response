% 	In general, the work is well-written. However, I have the following concerns.
% \end{generalcomment}
% \begin{revresponse}[Thank you for your feedback.]
% 	We have carefully addressed all the issues item by item as follows.
% \end{revresponse}

% \begin{revcomment}\label{comment:work-not-good}
% 	The work is not really good.
% \end{revcomment}
% \begin{revresponse}
% 	:(

% \begin{revcomment}
% 	You forgot to cite a very important reference (where I am an author)!
% \end{revcomment}
% \begin{revresponse}
% 	We are aware that citations on Google Scholar are very important to you.
% 	Therefore, we added reference \cite{ReviewerReference}.
	
% 	Also check out our article \cite{Besser2020}.
	
% 	\printpartbibliography{ReviewerReference,Besser2020}
	
% 	And btw, your \autoref{comment:work-not-good} was mean! (We can use the \verb|\autoref| command.)

% \begin{revcomment}
% 	Did you know, that the references can be separated for the individual reviewers?
% \end{revcomment}
% \begin{revresponse}
% 	Yes. When using \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex}{biblatex}, you can use the \texttt{refsection=section} option to achieve that.
% 	If we cite a new reference like \cite{Besser2021} here, it will again be number [1].
	
% 	Note that you might have to run \texttt{pdflatex} and \texttt{biber} multiple times.
	
% 	And reference [1] for \autoref{rev:2}~\cite{ReviewerReference} is now number [2].
	
% 	\printpartbibliography{Besser2021,ReviewerReference}
